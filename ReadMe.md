## Introduction
My Covid-19 Assistant is a simple android application developed to assist people during the pandemic, providing a virtual triage, advice, and a self-monitoring sheet table.

## Inspiration
After observing my family in quarantine get desperate over every symptom of sickness they had, independently if it was an indicator of Covid-19, performing unwise actions after the suspicion or confirmed contamination, and sometimes forgetting to fill in the 14-day contamination table. 

## What it does
An easy-to-use tool that helps common people by performing diagnostics of the symptoms' gravity and recommending procedures to the users based on the symptoms, relevant information or previously sickness, and isolation conditions. Providing a 14-day isolation diary to monitor the users that had contact with contaminated people, and a faq about the pandemic, as well.
